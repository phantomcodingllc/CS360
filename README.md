# The app I designed is a weight tracking program, where users can log their weight daily. Once logged, they are able to see it in chart form and see the progress they have made.
For this app to work, I needed a login/registration screen for users. Once they registered and logged in, it would take them to the main screen, where they could enter in all weight and dates. Lastly, I had privacy screen that allowed the user to sign up for text message notifications from the app regarding their goal weight and how close they are getting to it.
I wanted to make this as easy as possible, so I approached the app by working on 1 screen at a time. I went through and did the GUI for each screen, designing how I wanted it to look. Once I was satified with how everything looked, I then proceeded to work on the backend of each screen, to make all functionality work.
I used a combination of emulator devices and my physical android device to test the app and make sure all functionality worked as intended.
When worked on the app, I struggled with making all functionality on the backend work properly. This took me several days of /redacted/ before I finally got it to work.
